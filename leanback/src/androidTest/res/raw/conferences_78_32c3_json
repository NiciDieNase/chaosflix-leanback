In Iran, a country that practises some of the most stringent censorship and surveillance techniques in the world has seen this transformation reshape the way the government implements information controls online. While applications with popular usage on browsers such as Facebook and Twitter remain blocked through their mobile applications, platforms that predominantly exist in app form such as WhatsApp, Viber, and Instagram remain unblocked in the country. This talk will look at how the government is counteracting these policies through various means, including local imitation apps, and new programs such as ‘intelligent filtering’, and the Revolutionary Guards' “Spider” program. Additionally, a discussion of how Iranian Internet users use these platforms, especially in reference to digital security awareness and practices will be included.

Specifically, how does the data collected inform suspicion about a particular individual? In the context of U.S. law, can big data alone establish reasonable suspicion or should it just factor into the totality of the circumstances?

While PGP and S/MIME provide end-to-end encrypted mail, most users have yet to adopt these practices, and for users who have, these tools leave metadata, such as the subject, sender, and recipient, visible everywhere along a message’s path. SMTP&mdash;the ubiquitous mail transport protocol&mdash;has evolved over the years to add encryption and authentication, both of which take place behind the scenes and help guard against surveillance and spam. While these features are being increasingly deployed, our research shows that they are almost always configured in vulnerable ways&mdash;the details of which are hidden from the users sending and receiving mail. Even more disturbingly, these vulnerabilities are being widely exploited in the wild: in seven countries, more than 20% of inbound Gmail messages are downgraded to cleartext by network-based attacks. In the most severe case, 96% of messages sent from Tunisia to Gmail are downgraded to cleartext. In this talk, I’ll introduce the commonly used SMTP security extensions&mdash;including STARTTLS, SPF, DKIM, and DMARC&mdash;and describe the current state of mail security on the Internet. I'll describe several commonly occurring attacks our recent research has found and discuss how mail operators can configure their servers to secure email transport. Finally, I'll discuss several weaknesses in the protocols we're using and recent proposals for helping secure email transport.","original_language":"eng","persons":["Zakir Durumeric"],"tags":["Security"],"date":"2015-12-29T14:00:00.000+01:00","release_date":"2015-12-29","updated_at":"2017-03-23T18:30:04.708+01:00","length":2991,"thumb_url":"https://static.media.ccc.de/media/congress/2015/7255-hd.jpg","poster_url":"https://static.media.ccc.de/media/congress/2015/7255-hd_preview.jpg","frontend_link":"https://media.ccc.de/v/32c3-7255-neither_snow_nor_rain_nor_mitm_the_state_of_email_security_in_2015","url":"https://api.media.ccc.de/public/events/2885","conference_url":"https://api.media.ccc.de/public/conferences/78"},{"guid":"0c8f0e98-92ee-42ba-aa75-04fc50344904","title":"Ten years after ‚We Lost The War‘","subtitle":"The future does not look much brighter than ten years ago.

For example,\n    they are at the core of various Common-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) devices such as\n    printers, video surveillance systems, home routers and virtually anything we \n    informally call electronics. The emerging phenomenon of the Internet-of-Things\n    (IoT) will make them even more widespread and interconnected. Cisco famously\n    predicted that there will be 50 billion connected embedded devices by 2020.\n    Given those estimations, the heterogeneity of technology and application fields,\n    and the current threat landscape, the security of all those devices becomes of\n    paramount importance. In addition to this, manual security analysis does not\n    scale. Therefore, novel, scalable and automated approaches are needed.\n    In this talk, we present several methods that make *the large scale\n    security analyses of embedded devices* a feasible task. We implemented \n    those techniques in a scalable framework that we tested on real world data. \n    First, we collected a large number of firmware images from Internet \n    repositories and then performed simple static analysis. \n    Second, since embedded devices often expose web interfaces for \n    remote administration, therefore we developed techniques for large scale \n    static and dynamic analysis of such interfaces. \n    Finally, identifying and classifying the firmware files, as well as \n    fingerprinting and identifying embedded devices is difficult, especially \n    at large scale. \n    Using these techniques, we were able to discover a large number of new \n    vulnerabilities in dozens of firmware packages, affecting a great variety of vendors and\n    device classes. We were also able to achieve high accuracy in fingerprinting and\n    classification of both firmware images and live devices.","original_language":"eng","persons":["Andrei Costin"],"tags":["Security"],"date":"2015-12-29T11:30:00.000+01:00","release_date":"2015-12-29","updated_at":"2017-03-12T09:00:05.266+01:00","length":3545,"thumb_url":"https://static.media.ccc.de/media/congress/2015/7252-hd.jpg","poster_url":"https://static.media.ccc.de/media/congress/2015/7252-hd_preview.jpg","frontend_link":"https://media.ccc.de/v/32c3-7252-in_security_of_embedded_devices_firmware_-_fast_and_furious_at_large_scale","url":"https://api.media.ccc.de/public/events/2879","conference_url":"https://api.media.ccc.de/public/conferences/78"},{"guid":"72ad2630-b736-4d4c-8ea1-d982076426bc","title":"„Nach bestem Wissen und Gewissen“ – Floskeln in der Politik","subtitle":"Politische Phrasologie – warum man aus dem ganzen Zeug, das Politiker so reden, schlau werden kann","slug":"32c3-7150-nach_bestem_wissen_und_gewissen_floskeln_in_der_politik","link":"https://events.ccc.de/congress/2015/Fahrplan/events/7150.html","description":"In der politischen Rede sind immer wieder Floskeln zu beobachten, zum Teil gibt es Moden, wie im Zusammenhang mit dem so genannten No-Spy-Abkommen, wo Handlungen wiederholt mit „bestem Wissen und Gewissen“ gerechtfertigt wurden.

Researchers particularly in the fields of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Computer-Supported Collaborative Work (CSCW) but also in the social sciences generally have begun to study hacking empirically—investigating hacking as a practice and as cultural phenomenon. The talk offers a glimpse of the spectrum of research about hacking in HCI, CSCW, and adjacent fields. Researchers in these fields portray hacking very differently. The spectrum ranges from “transgressive craft” to “innovative leisure practice,” from skilled craftsmanship to ad hoc kludging, from an individualist pursuit to a community mission, from an expression of liberalism to an exclusive practice of cultural distinction. Some researchers see hacking as an illustration of how to defy technological determinism, i.e., the conviction that the technological determines the social, a position that social scientists typically fight ferociously. Other researchers see it as the future of “end-user innovation.” This talks discusses these notions and describes the value---economic, pedagogical, cultural, conceptual---that different research perspectives perceive in hacking.","original_language":"eng","persons":["Susann Wagenknecht"],"tags":["Science"],"date":"2015-12-29T22:00:00.000+01:00","release_date":"2015-12-30","updated_at":"2017-02-27T12:00:05.942+01:00","length":1948,"thumb_url":"https://static.media.ccc.de/media/congress/2015/7114-hd.jpg","poster_url":"https://static.media.ccc.de/media/congress/2015/7114-hd_preview.jpg","frontend_link":"https://media.ccc.de/v/32c3-7114-craft_leisure_and_end-user_innovation","url":"https://api.media.ccc.de/public/events/2914","conference_url":"https://api.media.ccc.de/public/conferences/78"},{"guid":"018148c1-62c9-4796-8443-2a8c8b8e3a01","title":"Gibberish Detection 102","subtitle":null,"slug":"32c3-7243-gibberish_detection_102","link":"https://events.ccc.de/congress/2015/Fahrplan/events/7243.html","description":"DGAs (Domain Generation Algorithms) have become a trusty fallback mechanism for malware that’s a headache to deal with, but they have one big drawback – they draw a lot of attention to themselves with their many DNS request for gibberish domains.","original_language":"eng","persons":["Ben H."],"tags":["Security"],"date":"2015-12-29T16:00:00.000+01:00","release_date":"2015-12-29","updated_at":"2017-02-27T23:30:05.023+01:00","length":3499,"thumb_url":"https://static.media.ccc.de/media/congress/2015/7243-hd.jpg","poster_url":"https://static.media.ccc.de/media/congress/2015/7243-hd_preview.jpg","frontend_link":"https://media.ccc.de/v/32c3-7243-gibberish_detection_102","url":"https://api.media.ccc.de/public/events/2888","conference_url":"https://api.media.ccc.de/public/conferences/78"},{"guid":"0bdbef2d-1594-4582-b315-7ee5da5505bf","title":"Fnord-Jahresrückblick","subtitle":null,"slug":"32c3-7282-fnord-jahresruckblick","link":"https://events.ccc.de/congress/2015/Fahrplan/events/7282.html","description":"Wir helfen euch, die Fnords zu sehen, wenn nach einem klaren Fall von Selbstmord der Zensor pinkeln war und die Stahlbälle den maximalen Realitätsabstand eingenommen haben.","original_language":"deu","persons":["Fefe","frank"],"tags":["Entertainment"],"date":"2015-12-29T00:15:00.000+01:00","release_date":"2015-12-29","updated_at":"2017-03-24T03:45:05.768+01:00","length":4681,"thumb_url":"https://static.media.ccc.de/media/congress/2015/7282-hd.jpg","poster_url":"https://static.media.ccc.de/media/congress/2015/7282-hd_preview.jpg","frontend_link":"https://media.ccc.de/v/32c3-7282-fnord-jahresruckblick","url":"https://api.media.ccc.de/public/events/2875","conference_url":"https://api.media.ccc.de/public/conferences/78"},{"guid":"ab751ee0-8623-4a20-bab3-f82f8cf3dd82","title":"Unpatchable","subtitle":"Living with a vulnerable implanted device","slug":"32c3-7273-unpatchable","link":"https://events.ccc.de/congress/2015/Fahrplan/events/7273.html","description":"Gradually we are all becoming more and more dependent on machines, we will be able to live longer with an increased quality of life due to machines integrated into our body.

Since Snowden we know for sure that intelligence agencies have access to the data storage of an  service provider, either by (forced) cooperation, or espionage. Thus, to protect our privacy we have to encrypted our data before hand it over to our service provider (data holder). But this approach contradicts the very idea of a web service where the data holder have to process our data in one way or an other. Therefore, we need new cryptographic techniques to enable the  data holder to perform operation on encrypted data. One of the most important operations for cloud storage or database based web/cloud  services is the search operation.  In this talk we focus on the very familiar cloud storage scenario. Because in this scenario, It is obvious, that the user (data owner) do not want to perform the search by himself. This should be a service offered by the data holder. We will present different practical approaches to achieve searchable ciphertext, namely one with an index and one with cleverly encrypted words.\n\nNote that no PhD is required to attend this talk ;-)","original_language":"eng","persons":["Tobias Mueller","Christian Forler"],"tags":["Science"],"date":"2015-12-30T11:30:00.000+01:00","release_date":"2015-12-30","updated_at":"2017-03-15T21:45:05.029+01:00","length":3527,"thumb_url":"https://static.media.ccc.de/media/congress/2015/7333-hd.jpg","poster_url":"https://static.media.ccc.de/media/congress/2015/7333-hd_preview.jpg","frontend_link":"https://media.ccc.de/v/32c3-7333-the_magic_world_of_searchable_symmetric_encryption","url":"https://api.media.ccc.de/public/events/2948","conference_url":"https://api.media.ccc.de/public/conferences/78"},{"guid":"a30bcf2c-1abf-4b7b-9554-a6dacbaeba52","title":"Avoiding kernel panic: Europe’s biggest fails in digital policy-making","subtitle":"How the institutions fuck up, and how we fuck it up as well","slug":"32c3-7227-avoiding_kernel_panic_europe_s_biggest_fails_in_digital_policy-making","link":"https://events.ccc.de/congress/2015/Fahrplan/events/7227.html","description":"In recent years, NGOs have been struggling to defend civil rights in Brussels.
