However, there are concerns that these technologies may be used, either with or without intention, to perpetuate the prejudice and unfairness that unfortunately characterizes many human institutions. We show for the first time that human-like semantic biases result from the application of standard machine learning to ordinary language—the same sort of language humans are exposed to every day. We replicate a spectrum of standard human biases as exposed by the Implicit Association Test and other well-known psychological studies. We replicate these using a widely used, purely statistical machine-learning model—namely, the GloVe word embedding—trained on a corpus of text from the Web. Our results indicate that language itself contains recoverable and accurate imprints of our historic biases, whether these are morally neutral as towards insects or flowers, problematic as towards race or gender, or even simply veridical, reflecting the status quo for the distribution of gender with respect to careers or first names. These regularities are captured by machine learning along with the rest of semantics. In addition to our empirical findings concerning language, we also contribute new methods for evaluating bias in text, the Word Embedding Association Test (WEAT) and the Word Embedding Factual Association Test (WEFAT). Our results have implications not only for AI and machine learning, but also for the fields of psychology, sociology, and human ethics, since they raise the possibility that mere exposure to everyday language can account for the biases we replicate here.","original_language":"eng","persons":["Aylin Caliskan"],"tags":["Science"],"date":"2016-12-27T16:45:00.000+01:00","release_date":"2016-12-27","updated_at":"2017-03-24T22:15:05.236+01:00","length":3600,"thumb_url":"https://static.media.ccc.de/media/congress/2016/8026-hd.jpg","poster_url":"https://static.media.ccc.de/media/congress/2016/8026-hd_preview.jpg","frontend_link":"https://media.ccc.de/v/33c3-8026-a_story_of_discrimination_and_unfairness","url":"https://api.media.ccc.de/public/events/3619","conference_url":"https://api.media.ccc.de/public/conferences/101"},{"guid":"f6811c99-96af-44d5-b82d-5afe826b2caf","title":"A world without blockchain","subtitle":"How (inter)national money transfers works","slug":"33c3-8315-a_world_without_blockchain","link":"https://fahrplan.events.ccc.de/congress/2016/Fahrplan/events/8315.html","description":"Instant money transfer, globally without borders and 24/7.

In the absence of a dedicated hardware True Random Number Generator (TRNG), computer systems have to resort to a software (cryptographically secure) Pseudo-Random Number Generator (CSPRNG). Since the (secure) design of a CSPRNG is an involved and complicated effort and since randomness is such a security-critical resource, many operating systems provide a CSPRNG as a core system service and many popular security software products assume their presence. The constraints imposed by the embedded world, however, pose a variety of unique challenges to proper OS (CS)PRNG design and implementation which have historically resulted in security failures. In this talk we will discuss these challenges, how they affect the quality of (CS)PRNGs in embedded operating systems and illustrate our arguments by means of the first public analysis of the OS random number generators of several popular embedded operating systems.","original_language":"eng","persons":["Jos Wetzels","Ali Abbasi"],"tags":["Security"],"date":"2016-12-28T13:45:00.000+01:00","release_date":"2016-12-28","updated_at":"2017-03-24T19:15:05.100+01:00","length":2208,"thumb_url":"https://static.media.ccc.de/media/congress/2016/7949-hd.jpg","poster_url":"https://static.media.ccc.de/media/congress/2016/7949-hd_preview.jpg","frontend_link":"https://media.ccc.de/v/33c3-7949-wheel_of_fortune","url":"https://api.media.ccc.de/public/events/3658","conference_url":"https://api.media.ccc.de/public/conferences/101"},{"guid":"5f0ab68a-8e2d-481e-b009-55a1af58760c","title":"The Clash of Digitalizations","subtitle":"The Devolution of Arab Men from Humans to Digital Fodder","slug":"33c3-8419-the_clash_of_digitalizations","link":"https://fahrplan.events.ccc.de/congress/2016/Fahrplan/events/8419.html","description":"This talk discusses the representation of Arab males in video games and the adverse effect it has on the collective political imagination.

The picture at the primary school level is fuzzier, as students do not declare majors at that level, but evidence indicates the trend starts from a young age. Can we make computer education more gender-inclusive? Presenting technology in familiar, non-threatening contexts can lead to more balanced gender participation. For example, Chibitronics uses the context of papercraft to present electronics to beginners; the familiarity of papercraft improves the participation of women of all ages in the creation of electronics. Based on these learnings, we have devised the “Love to Code” platform, an open source hardware-to-cloud stack which combines the familiarity of paper craft with a web-based, driver-free embedded firmware development environment based on FSK audio provisioning via a headphone jack. In this talk, we will dive into the novel open source technical contributions of this platform, which includes the audio-based provisioning protocol and the unique rigid-flex design of the circuitry enabling papercraft integration, as well as the multi-threaded client OS and cloud infrastructure required to complete the picture.

Most if not all SDRs in the affordable price range are using USB2/USB3 as a transport, because of implementation simplicity. While being so popular, USB has limited bandwidth, high latency and is not really suitable for embedded applications. PCIe/miniPCIe is the only widespread bus which is embedded friendly, low latency and high bandwidth at the same time. But implementing PCIe/miniPCIe is not for the faint of heart - you have to write your own FPGA code, write your own Linux kernel driver and ensure compatibility with different chipsets, each with its own quirks. In this talk we will look at the requirements for a high performance SDR like XTRX, how this leads to certain design decisions and share pitfalls and gotchas we encountered (and solved).","original_language":"eng","persons":["Alexander Chemeris","Sergey Kostanbaev"],"tags":["Hardware & Making"],"date":"2016-12-27T12:45:00.000+01:00","release_date":"2016-12-27","updated_at":"2017-03-24T14:00:04.503+01:00","length":3654,"thumb_url":"https://static.media.ccc.de/media/congress/2016/8338-hd.jpg","poster_url":"https://static.media.ccc.de/media/congress/2016/8338-hd_preview.jpg","frontend_link":"https://media.ccc.de/v/33c3-8338-building_a_high_throughput_low-latency_pcie_based_sdr","url":"https://api.media.ccc.de/public/events/3602","conference_url":"https://api.media.ccc.de/public/conferences/101"},{"guid":"f1e2dc22-8925-4a8a-8cd3-4d03aa0e33b7","title":"The Moon and European Space Exploration","subtitle":"Refocusing on the moon as a platform for future deep space missoins","slug":"33c3-8406-the_moon_and_european_space_exploration","link":"https://fahrplan.events.ccc.de/congress/2016/Fahrplan/events/8406.html","description":"Since the early successes of moon missions in the Sixtie, mankind has moved on to the earth orbit and other deep space missions.

We explored the remix-relationships—accessible due the community’s use of open licenses—of more than 200.000 individual designs, tracked an entire week’s new designs for half a year, interviewed more than 80 creators and surveyed over 200 more. This allowed us to develop a deep understanding of the creative processes that take place on the platform.\nIn this talk we would like to present our findings. This is of interest to people who care about 3D printing as we can give sort of a behind the scenes view on how ideas come to life here. But it is also interesting to people that care about creativity in general. As what we have found has merit outside of 3D printing, too. In this talk we would like to cover the following: (1) Introduce our research setting and explain why it is useful to study this, (2) provide a consolidated overview on our most interesting findings, and (3) give real life examples for how these findings are transferable to other settings.\nWe have presented primary results of the studies at various academic conferences and have a comprehensive paper on the project currently under revision at the Journal of Information Technology (see attached file). We are a group of three university professors and a Ph.D. student. We work on the intersection of information systems, innovation management, product development, and creativity. We believe that many of the people we studied either attend 33C3 or watch talks online and we therefore think that our results would be of interest to this community. Further, we feel that a well structured talk is better and more entertaining than mailing around our academic journal publications to those who are interested. And lastly, we are eager to receive feedback from a more hands-on audience (than what we deal with at academic conferences). It would be especially useful for us to hear of new developments, discuss ideas for follow-up research projects, and get access to creators that would like to work with us in the future.","original_language":"eng","persons":["Sascha Friesike"],"tags":["Science"],"date":"2016-12-29T22:00:00.000+01:00","release_date":"2016-12-30","updated_at":"2017-03-24T15:15:05.573+01:00","length":1701,"thumb_url":"https://static.media.ccc.de/media/congress/2016/8039-hd.jpg","poster_url":"https://static.media.ccc.de/media/congress/2016/8039-hd_preview.jpg","frontend_link":"https://media.ccc.de/v/33c3-8039-what_we_can_learn_about_creativity_from_3d_printing","url":"https://api.media.ccc.de/public/events/3729","conference_url":"https://api.media.ccc.de/public/conferences/101"},{"guid":"0a3b7891-6446-4ef7-afc4-e95c21193c68","title":"Formal Verification of Verilog HDL with Yosys-SMTBMC","subtitle":null,"slug":"33c3-7922-formal_verification_of_verilog_hdl_with_yosys-smtbmc","link":"https://fahrplan.events.ccc.de/congress/2016/Fahrplan/events/7922.html","description":"Yosys is a free and open source Verilog synthesis tool and more.

To meet these demands, a new ultrasound-based technology has recently emerged and is already utilized in a number of different real-world applications. Ultrasound tracking comes with a number of desirable features (e.g., easy to deploy, inaudible to humans), but alarmingly until now no comprehensive security analysis of the technology has been conducted. In this talk, we will publish the results of our security analysis of the ultrasound tracking ecosystem, and demonstrate the practical security and privacy risks that arise with its adoption. Subsequently, we will introduce some immediately deployable defense mechanisms for practitioners, researchers, and everyday users. Finally, we will initiate the discussion for the standardization of ultrasound beacons, and outline our proposed OS-level API that enables both secure and effortless deployment for ultrasound-enabled applications.","original_language":"eng","persons":["Vasilios Mavroudis","Federico Maggi"],"tags":["Security"],"date":"2016-12-29T17:15:00.000+01:00","release_date":"2016-12-29","updated_at":"2017-03-24T16:45:05.776+01:00","length":3543,"thumb_url":"https://static.media.ccc.de/media/congress/2016/8336-hd.jpg","poster_url":"https://static.media.ccc.de/media/congress/2016/8336-hd_preview.jpg","frontend_link":"https://media.ccc.de/v/33c3-8336-talking_behind_your_back","url":"https://api.media.ccc.de/public/events/3706","conference_url":"https://api.media.ccc.de/public/conferences/101"},{"guid":"ef62eb53-cb69-42c6-aab0-bc9d3b0e1e92","title":"ATMs how to break them to stop the fraud","subtitle":null,"slug":"33c3-8273-atms_how_to_break_them_to_stop_the_fraud","link":"https://fahrplan.events.ccc.de/congress/2016/Fahrplan/events/8273.html","description":"How to stop the ATMs fraud?

Aber was machte z.B. ein Kaffeeriecher? Er war kein Hipster-Barista, sondern ein Auswuchs der Politik von Friedrich II.: durch den Schmuggel von Kaffeebohnen sah sich Friedrich II genötigt, ausgediente Kriegsveteranen durch Berlin zu schicken. Sie durften in die Häuser der Bürger eindringen, um unversteuerten Kaffee aufzufinden. Sie verletzten dabei die Privatsphäre und schnüffelten buchstäblich nach einem Vergehen. Anders als die Überwachung im Netz heute waren sie laut und derb und nicht unsichtbar. Den Bürgern waren sie so verhasst, dass sie sich gegen sie aufbäumten. Nach nur acht Jahre war der Spuk vorbei, die Kaffeeriecher wurden durch Protest des Volkes ausrangiert. Wäre es heute nur so einfach.\n\nAkribisch nach Fakten, Formen und Verbindungen suchend, entstand auch die Auftragsarbeit „Altes Handwerk“ , für die Stiftung Preußischer Kulturbesitz: ein Jahr lang wühlte Michaela Vieser in den Archiven des BPK: zum Teil lagen die Bilder in einer alten Kegelbahn in einem Offizierskasino in Charlottenburg. Die Fotografien stammen aus einer Zeit, als der Fotograf selbst noch Handwerker war. Anhand der Bilder lassen sich Ästhetik und Funktionalität des neuen Berufes klar erkennen. Das Buch wurde gemeinsam in einem Interview mit dem Bundesarbeitsminister im Radio vorgestellt, es war über zwei Jahre lang das wichtigste Buch des Verlags Braun editions.\n\nIm Folgewerk „Das Zeitalter der Maschinen – Von der Industrialisierung des Lebens“ geht es um den Übergang in die Industrielle Revolution:\n„Die Zeit“ schreibt: „Seit der Industrialisierung bestimmen Maschinen unseren Alltag – damals waren sie aus Eisen und Stahl, und manche überlebensgroß. Heute denken wir über die winzigen Chips schon gar nicht mehr nach, die Smartphones oder Autos steuern. Doch damals revolutionierten die Maschinen nicht nur die Wirtschaft, sondern das ganze Leben. Ein neuer Bildband vermittelt einen Eindruck davon, wie sehr.“ Michaela Vieser zieht im Vorwort die Parallele zur Digitalen Revolution.","original_language":"deu","persons":["Michaela Vieser"],"tags":["Art & Culture"],"date":"2016-12-28T14:30:00.000+01:00","release_date":"2016-12-28","updated_at":"2017-03-25T00:00:05.141+01:00","length":3600,"thumb_url":"https://static.media.ccc.de/media/congress/2016/8418-hd.jpg","poster_url":"https://static.media.ccc.de/media/congress/2016/8418-hd_preview.jpg","frontend_link":"https://media.ccc.de/v/33c3-8418-von_kaffeeriechern_abtrittanbietern_und_fischbeinreissern","url":"https://api.media.ccc.de/public/events/3660","conference_url":"https://api.media.ccc.de/public/conferences/101"}]}
